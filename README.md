# Eye Tracker Analyzer

Eye Tracker Analyzer is a MATLAB-based toolbox for segmenting, extracting, visualizing and analyzing oculomotor data. The toolbox was produced in order to enable researchers interested in exploring their eye movement data an ability to do so without requiring extensive expertise.

The toolbox:
- Implements an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) for less code-experienced users
- Allows easy parsing and segmentation of oculomotor data
- Implements an adapted version of [Enbgert & Kliegl's (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0042-6989(03)00084-1) microsaccade detection algorithm, with all parameters customizable via GUI
- Visualizes saccade detection quality and allows semi-automatic editing of it
- Production of various oculomotor measures, including (micro)saccade rate, velocity, amplitudes, fixation durations, eye vergence and more
- Production of individual-level and group-level plots

The toolbox was developed and tested in [Prof. Shlomit Yuval-Greenberg's lab](https://people.socsci.tau.ac.il/mu/shlomitgreenberg/) by multiple authors (see credits).

## Minimal requirements
In order to run the toolbox, you should install:
- MATLAB version 2017b or later
- [Signal Processing Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/signal.html)
- [Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html)

Currently, the toolbox only operates on Windows OS (10 and up).

In order to use the auto-update functionality (see Staying up-to-date below), you need:
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

## Installation

Download the .zip file or clone via git or GitHub Desktop

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shlomitya/eye-tracker-analyzer.git
```

## Usage

1. Start MATLAB
2. Navigate to the folder containing Eye Tracker Analyzer
3. Type eyeTrackerAnalyzer in MATLAB command prompt or run the script called eyeTrackerAnalyzer.m

Please check the [repository's wiki](https://github.com/shlomitya/eye-tracker-analyzer/wiki) for detailed instructions.

## Staying up-to-date
To check for updates, type eyeTrackerAnalyzerEXE in the MATLAB command prompt or run the script called eyeTrackerAnalyzerEXE.m

The script will check your local repository against changes made in the master and offer to download the new version if available. Git must be installed locally in order to run this script.

NOTE: Any unsaved local changes will be overwritten!
